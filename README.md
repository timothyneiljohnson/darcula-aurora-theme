# Darcula Aurora (VS Code Theme)

![Darcula Aroura screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timothyneiljohnson/darcula-aurora-theme/main/darcula-aurora.png "Darcula Aroura")

A cross between two of my favorite [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) themes: [_Darcula_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rokoroku.vscode-theme-darcula) and [_Nord Aurora_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Avetis.nord-palette).

This theme was created with the following principles in mind:
* Backgrounds should ideally be 100% neutral. ⚖️
* Colors should belong to one cohesive, pleasing pallete. 🎨
* Color usage should stay purposeful and functional. 🛠️
* Red should be reserved to indicate errors. 🚫
* Medium contrast and brightness to help reduce eyestrain. 👀


**Enjoy!**
